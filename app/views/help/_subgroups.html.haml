  %h1 Sub-groups
  %p Often you will have a need for multiple Loomio groups that are all related to one organisation, but you may find that each group has different needs for membership, privacy and permissions. This is where sub-groups are useful.

      %p If you wish to create a sub-group within a group, and you have the correct permissions you can do so by clicking the <strong>“Create a sub-group”</strong> link in the <strong>“Sub-groups”</strong> panel on the right-hand side of your group page.

      %p To change a sub-group’s settings, visit its page, then click <strong>“Options”</strong> and <strong>“Edit group setttings”</strong>. Sub-group settings are the same as <a href="#group-settings">group settings</a>, with one additional privacy option. The additional option (visible underneath <strong>“Who can find this group?”</strong> in the <strong>“Privacy”</strong> section of the new sub-group form) determines whether people in the parent group can see the sub-group. When the <strong>“People in [parent group]”</strong> option is selected then the group will be visible to members of the parent group, even if they are not members of the sub-group. When this option is deselected, only members of the sub-group will be able to find it.
