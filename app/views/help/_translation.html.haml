  %p Translation of Loomio is done by an amazing community of generous volunteers, using a tool called Transifex. If youâ€™re interested in taking part in the translation process a good place to start is reading our Translation guide and joining our Community Translation sub-group. You can request membership from the group page and your request will be approved by group coordinator. You can introduce yourself and get a sense of who is in the wider translation community in this introductory discussion.
  %p If you have any questions about the translation process contact <strong>mix@loomio.org</strong>.
